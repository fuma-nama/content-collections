## Introduction

Content Collections transforms your content into type-safe data collections, providing useful utilities for data fetching and parsing.

### Installation

Content Collection supports most of the major web frameworks. Choose the one you are using to get started.

<QuickStartList />

If your framework is not listed, you can still use Content Collections
by using the [CLI](/docs/quickstart/cli). Please open
a [ticket](https://github.com/sdorra/content-collections/issues)
if you want to see your framework listed.

### How it works?

Content Collections works by generating an array of documents for each collection you define.
Each document is a TypeScript object that represents a file in your project.

The documents are generated from the files in the collection directory, all files must match the specified glob pattern.

### How to use it?

To use the generated documents in your project, you can import the generated files.
Type information is available as TypeScript definitions.

Refer to the [installation guide](#frameworks) for more information on how to set up the Content Collections for your framework.

### What is a Collection?

Once you have configured an import alias, you can import the generated files in your project with:

```ts
import { posts } from "content-collections";
```

The `posts` object is a collection, it contains an array of documents that you can use in your project.
Each document has the shape defined in the collection configuration.
You can access the properties of the document as you would with any other TypeScript object.

Here is an example of how you can use the `posts` object in your project:

```ts
import { posts } from "content-collections";

posts.forEach((post) => {
  console.log(post.title);
  console.log(post.summary);
});
```

Each document has a `_meta` property (unless it has been removed in the `transform` function) that contains metadata about the document, such as the file path and the file name.
