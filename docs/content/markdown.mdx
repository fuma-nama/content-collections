There are various ways to utilize markdown files with Content Collections. One approach is using packages like [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) for runtime compilation. Another method involves using [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) for compilation during the build process. The `@content-collections/markdown` package streamlines remark's usage with Content Collections.

This package is designed for integration into a [transform](/docs/transform) function. It converts plain markdown content into HTML, caching the HTML to avoid unnecessary recompilations and enhance the build speed.

## Quickstart

Install the package:

```package-install
npm i @content-collections/markdown -D
```

Transform the markdown content to HTML:

```ts
import { defineCollection, defineConfig } from "@content-collections/core";
import { compileMarkdown } from "@content-collections/markdown";

const posts = defineCollection({
  name: "posts",
  directory: "content",
  include: "*.md",
  schema: (z) => ({
    title: z.string(),
  }),
  transform: async (document, context) => {
    const html = await compileMarkdown(context, document);
    return {
      ...document,
      html,
    };
  },
});

export default defineConfig({
  collections: [posts],
});
```

Use the generated html in your application.

The following snippet shows an example with React.

```tsx
import { allPosts } from "content-collections";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {allPosts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post._meta.path}>
            <h2>{post.title}</h2>
            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.html }} />
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}
```

And the next snippet shows an example with Svelte.

```svelte
<script>
  import { allPosts } from "content-collections";
</script>

<h1>Posts</h1>

<ul>
  {#each allPosts as post}
    <li>
      <h2>{post.title}</h2>
      <div>{@html post.html}</div>
    </li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

And the last snippet shows an example with Solid.

```tsx
import { allPosts } from "content-collections";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {allPosts.map((post) => (
          <li>
            <h2>{post.title}</h2>
            <div innerHTML={post.html} />
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## API

The package exports a single function, `compileMarkdown`, which takes two required arguments: the context object and the document and a third optional argument, the options object.

The document must have a `content` field of the type `string` and should contain the markdown content. The document also needs to have the `_meta` field with the file information. In most uses cases the document which is passed to the transform function can be used directly.

The context object is required to cache the compiled HTML. The context object is passed to the transform function and should be passed to the `compileMarkdown` function.

The options object is optional and can be used to tweak the output of the compiled HTML. The options object can have the following properties:

### `remarkPlugins` (optional)

An array of remark plugins to use. The default value is an empty array.

### `rehypePlugins` (optional)

An array of rehype plugins to use. The default value is an empty array.

### `allowDangerousHtml` (optional)

A boolean to allow dangerous HTML. The default value is `false`.

It is not necessary to use plugins for frontmatter, because the frontmatter is already parsed by Content Collections.

The `compileMarkdown` function returns a promise that resolves to a string with the compiled HTML.
